Sure! Here’s a sample README.md for your Selenium mouse actions project using POM with real-world URLs, including slider, drag and drop, hover, etc.

# Selenium Mouse Actions Automation Project

This project demonstrates how to automate complex mouse actions using Selenium WebDriver with Python, following the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern. It covers real-world web interactions including:

- Mouse Hover
- Double Click
- Right Click (Context Click)
- Scrolling
- Slider manipulation
- Drag and Drop

## Setup

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/selenium_mouse_actions.git
   cd selenium_mouse_actions
````

2. (Optional) Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate      # Linux / macOS
   .venv\Scripts\activate.bat     # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Ensure you have the appropriate browser driver (e.g., `chromedriver`) in your PATH.

## Running Tests

Use `pytest` to run tests. Example:

```bash
pytest tests/test_slider.py
```

Or run all tests:

```bash
pytest
```

## Key Features

* Uses Selenium WebDriver with Python
* Implements **Page Object Model** for maintainability and reusability
* Demonstrates real mouse actions:

  * **Slider** manipulation by pixel offset
  * **Drag and Drop** actions
  * **Mouse Hover**, **Double Click**, **Right Click**
  * Scrolling to elements
* Includes assertions to verify UI changes after actions

## Example: Slider Test

```python
def test_slider(driver):
    page = SlidePage(driver)
    page.open("https://demoqa.com/slider")
    slider_value = page.move_slider(98)
    print(f"Slider moved to value: {slider_value}")
```

## Notes

* Offsets for slider or drag/drop are in **pixels**, which may require calibration depending on screen resolution and browser window size.
* Use explicit waits in BasePage to ensure element readiness.
* Adjust locators and URLs as needed for your testing context.
